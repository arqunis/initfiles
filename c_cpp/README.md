# Layouts for C and C++ projects

The layouts here use C++ for example code, but can be easily switched to use C
instead.

They are prepared such that they provide a good starting point for both building
and distributing C and C++ projects for platforms such as Windows, MacOS, Linux
distributions, or BSD operating systems.
